        "details": "Our company representative will pick you up from the airport or your accommodation facility. After a short briefing about the safari, you will be handed over to your experienced driver guide in the morning for a scenic drive southeast towards Amboseli National Park, arriving in good time for lunch. You'll embark on your first-afternoon game drive exploring this acacia woodland, freshwater swamps, scrub brush, and open plains in search of wildlife returning at sunset for dinner and your overnight stay. Amboseli National Park (392sq km) is famously known for the breathtaking view of Mount Kilimanjaro, the tallest freestanding mountain on earth and the tallest in Africa (5895m). Amboseli is also an elephantâ€™s paradise where the massive African savannah elephants roam from swamp to swamp grazing all day. Because of the abundance of water and pasture, other animals to be spotted here are cheetahs, zebras, giraffes, gnus, gazelles, hippos, and many others.",
